# Input.txt
As a Sample input I have inserted some sentences that I assumed have been searched multiple times.

# SearchAutoCompleteSystem.cpp
This File contains the program which works the following way :

1) Reading the file and Adding all the sentences and frequencies in Trie Data Structure.
2) Start Taking input letter by letter and calculate results for the same. (Showing only the top 3 results for now)
3) When The user enters '#' we assume the word is complete and final results are shown.
4) Add the Searched sentence in the Trie Data Structure with increased frequency.
   
# Output
The Output for the Input File on the Compiler is shown.
